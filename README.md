# Fusion Ledgers
EPIC Knowledge Society is building a Decentralised Data Fusion Ledger leveraging the power of cutting edge cryptographic primitives such as ZK SNARKS, Zokrates, Pendersen Commitments, Random Oracles, and Distributed Data Structures such as Direct Acyclic Graphs, Merkle Trees and JSON Schema. The fusion ledger is currently deployed using Ethereum and IPFS. We are planning the next iteration in Algorand and Aeternity. We will also upgrade the cryptographic primitives using ZK STARKS, Homomorphic Commitments, Interactive Oracle Proofs and Verifiable Random Functions. The fusion ledger is completely open source and currently in the prototyping phase. If anyone of you would like to contribute to the design and development of fusion ledger, please contact us at the email address - epicknowledgesociety@gmail.com
